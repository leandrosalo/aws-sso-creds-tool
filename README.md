# AWS SSO Credentials Tool
##### (couldn't find a better name)

This **AWS SSO Credentials Tool** is a script in nodejs to (almost)automatically update your locally credentials file of aws.

I say _almost_ because at some point you'll need to click a button (or two in the worst scenario).

## Motivation
The SSO credentials expires every day, so I did not want to update this file manually. 

## Requirements
* *Necessary:* Node.js - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), including the npm package management tool.

## How to use

### Update .env file with the correct params
It is required to set the sso url like this:
```shell
SSO_URL="https://<your-project>.awsapps.com/start#/"
```

The credentials will be stored as __[account-name_AWSRoleName]__.
If you want to store it as __[123456789098_AWSRoleName]__ add this:
```shell
USE_ACCOUNT_ID=true
````
_if you want a different profile name update the code..._

By default, it uses us-east-1 as aws region and searches for the credentials file in the default path.
If you want to change it, add this:
```shell
REGION=us-east-1
AWS_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/Users/you/.aws/credentials
```

### First time use
1. Run `npm install` in this folder
2. Update the `.env` with the correct values
3. Run `node app.js`
4. At some point the aws webpage will popup
    1. Log in to aws if you are not already
    2. The code for device authentication will be auto filled
    3. Click on Sign In

5. When the success alert shows then come back to the terminal and press a key

7. Done!
